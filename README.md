# Dispatch.io 🚀

A sophisticated mobile career ecosystem architected with **React Native** and **Expo**. Dispatch.io redefines the job search experience by integrating neural-matching logic to align candidate profiles with global opportunities in real-time.

## Project Overview
Dispatch.io is more than a job board; it is a career accelerator. Built for the modern professional, the platform features a sleek, high-performance interface that leverages **NativeWind** for dynamic styling and **Expo Router** for frictionless navigation. The highlight of the application is the **Dispatch Brain**, an AI-driven optimization layer that rewrites and aligns resumes to specific job requirements with a single tap.

## Key Features
*   **Neural Alignment Engine**: An AI-powered interface that analyzes job descriptions and suggests real-time resume refinements to maximize match rates.
*   **Intelligent Dashboard**: A centralized hub for tracking application statuses, including views, interview invites, and pending technical tests.
*   **Universal Search & Filtering**: Advanced job discovery tools with category-based chips and location-aware filtering.
*   **Secure Auth Workflow**: A robust authentication system featuring secure OTP (One-Time Password) verification and email-based login.
*   **Fluid UX/UI**: High-fidelity animations powered by **Lottie** and **Moti**, with full support for system-wide Dark and Light themes.
*   **Interactive Job Feed**: Rich job cards displaying salary ranges, company logos, and metadata tags with bookmarking capabilities.

## Usage Documentation
### 1. Onboarding Journey
The application begins with a high-fidelity onboarding sequence. Each screen utilizes **Lottie animations** to communicate core value propositions: AI refinement, automated applications, and smart job matching. Users can navigate through the sequence or skip directly to the authentication portal.

### 2. Authentication & Verification
Dispatch.io implements a secure email-first entry. 
*   **Signup/Login**: Users enter their email and are prompted to create a password with real-time security requirement tracking (length, characters, numbers).
*   **OTP Verification**: To ensure account security, a 5-digit verification code is sent. The interface features auto-focusing input fields and a resend timer logic.

### 3. The Discovery Feed
The Feed is the heart of the application. Users can search for specific roles or filter by categories like "Remote," "Engineering," or "Design." Each job card is interactive, allowing users to view full requirements, company details, and salary benchmarks before applying.

### 4. Neural Application Workflow (AI Co-Pilot)
When applying, users can trigger the **AI Optimizer**. 
*   **Scanning**: The "Dispatch Brain" scans the user's master profile against the target job API.
*   **Refinement**: The system suggests specific bullet-point rewrites (e.g., changing generic experience into impact-driven metrics).
*   **Dispatch**: Once aligned, the application is sent with a confirmed high match percentage.
